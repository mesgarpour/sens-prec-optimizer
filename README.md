## About SensPrecOptimizer
SensPrecOptimizer is a freeware software for developing _Highly Sensitive Search Strategies_ by combining the search queries. _Highly Sensitive Search Strategies_ refers to the two strategies recommended by the [Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions](http://handbook.cochrane.org/): a sensitivity-maximizing version and a sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version.
      
### Install
You may download the software packages directly from below. They are in zip format and must be decompressed before setup.

  * [**Windows (6.0 and above)**](https://github.com/mesgarpour/sens-prec-optimizer/blob/master/SensPrecOptimizer_Windows_Ver.zip) : *It is recommended to use the Windows version, since it is fully optimised.*
